We tried everything but finally had to crack open the case just to get one needle out. The thread was poor quality and frayed as you handled it. The threader lasted only about 10 seconds. The scissors were not aligned properly. I know this kit wasn't expensive (as I said, I just wanted some needles), but even so, it wasn't worth the money.\n  \nRead more",
